# Prerequisites

Currently, to write, compile, and run smart contracts for Athena, you need to have:

1. Ubuntu 22.04 or newer (support for other operating systems is planned),
1. the Rust language, and
1. the Athena VM and the Athena toolchain installed on your system.

## Getting Started

To start, simply enter the following command in a terminal to install Athena and the Athena toolchain:

`curl -L http://install.athenavm.org | bash && athup`

Once these are successfully installed, you are now ready to compile and run your first Athena smart contract!
