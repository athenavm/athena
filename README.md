# Athena

Athena is a prototype deterministic smart contract engine that serves as the [Spacemesh network VM][2], and Athena is being designed and built by the  [Spacemesh][8] team. However, Athena is designed to be modular and largely protocol-agnostic so [it will run on other chains][9]. Contributions and integrations are welcome.

Athena includes a virtual machine (VM) based on the RISC-V ISA, including support for [RV32IM][10] and [RV32EM][1], an interpreter/compiler for running smart contract code, and related tooling. The VM is modular and features a mature FFI that can be integrated into any language that supports CFFI. For more information on the Athena project and its goals see [Introducing Athena][2] and the [Athena project updates][3].

## Project Goals
- **Developer Experience**: Provide a robust environment with extensive tooling support.
- **Simplicity**: VMs tend to be extraordinarily complex. The Athena codebase is clean and contains an order of magnitude less code than most VMs.
- **Modularity**: Athena is totally self-contained and agnostic to the environment where it runs. It has a well-defined Host<>VM CFFI API and ABI that can be used to swap hosts or VMs, and Athena can talk to a host written in Go or another compatible language.
- **Performance**: Ensure fast execution of smart contracts. (Note that this is a long-term goal and is not a goal at this prototype phase.)
- **Small On-Chain Footprint**: Deployed Athena code should be as compact as possible.
- **Security**: Implement strong isolation and safety measures.
- **ZK Provability**: Ensure provability in zero-knowledge (ZK) environments; aim to natively target RISC-V-based ZK circuits.
- **Mainline Rust Support**: Allow writing Athena code using ordinary Rust and compiling with the standard Rust/LLVM pipeline. Aim to provide as much stdlib support as possible.

## Non-Goals
- **Floating Point Support**: No support for floating-point operations.
- **SIMD**: No support for Single Instruction, Multiple Data operations.
- **Additional RISC-V Extensions**: No RISC-V extensions beyond the M extension.
- **Interoperability**: At this time Athena is not intended to interoperate with, or target, other blockchain VMs.
- **Full System Emulation**: Athena is not intended to run an operating system or standard application binaries. Try https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu.

## Progress

Athena is currently in a prototype stage. The goal of this stage of the project is to create a working, end to end proof of concept VM that successfully and securely executes transactions on a testnet. We also intend to test proving these transactions in ZK. Here's a map of the immediate goals and progress. See the [Project boards][12] for more up to date progress.
