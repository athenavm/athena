# Prerequisites

Currently, to write, compile, and run smart contracts for Athena, you need to have:

1. Ubuntu 22.04 or newer (support for other operating systems is planned and contributions are welcome),
1. the Rust language, and
1. the Athena VM and the Athena toolchain installed on your system.

## Getting Started

To start, simply enter the following command in a terminal:

`curl -L http://install.athenavm.org | bash`

Follow the instructions to add Athena to your shell's path directory, then run

`athup`

to download and install the Athena Rust toolchain. Once these are successfully installed, you are now ready to compile
and run your first Athena program!
